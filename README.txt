PAI: Homework 5 --- Gibbs sampling in Bayesian networks
=======================================================

In this homework you have to implement a Gibbs sampler for Bayesian networks.

Dependencies
------------

To run the code,  you will need the following Python libraries:

  * networkx
  * matplotlib
  * numpy

You can install the dependencies with your package manager, or you can use pip:

    sudo pip install networkx matplotlib numpy

Task
----

Implement the missing parts in sampling.py (the ones with # TODO comments).
Then, you can run 

    python demo.py

to see if you get correct results on the coin flipping network from exercise 2
of Problem Set 2.
