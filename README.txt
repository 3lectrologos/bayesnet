PAI: Homework 3 --- d-separation in Bayesian networks
=====================================================

In this homework you have to implement d-separation.

Dependencies
------------

To run the code,  you will need the following Python libraries:

  * networkx
  * matplotlib

You can install the dependencies with your package manager, or you can use pip:

    sudo pip install networkx matplotlib

Task
----

Implement the missing parts of the core.py file (the ones with # TODO comments).
Then, you can run 

    python demo.py

to see if you get correct results on a simple v-structure network. For more
example networks, look at examples_dsep.py.
